# Project: HTML Media Page

A simple web page developed as part of my initial studies in HTML5. The main objective was to practice embedding and controlling different types of media, such as images and videos, as well as reinforcing the basic structure of an HTML document.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* HTML5

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

With this project, I practiced and reinforced the following concepts:

* **Media Embedding:** Use of the `<img>` and `<video>` tags to display media from local files.
* **List Structuring:** Implementation of ordered (`<ol>`), unordered (`<ul>`), and definition (`<dl>`) lists.
* **Hyperlink Creation:** Use of the `<a>` tag to create links to external pages, using the `target="_blank"` attribute to open them in a new tab.
